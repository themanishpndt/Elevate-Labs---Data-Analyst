# Data Analyst Internship - Task 1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

📋 Project Overview

This repository contains my complete solution for Task 1 of the Data Analyst Internship at Elevate Labs. The project demonstrates comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing skills on a raw customer dataset containing various real-world data quality issues.

🎯 Objective

Clean and prepare a raw dataset by handling:

· ✅ Missing values identification and treatment
· ✅ Duplicate records removal
· ✅ Inconsistent formats standardization (dates, text categories)
· ✅ Column headers normalization
· ✅ Data type corrections and validation
· ✅ Outlier detection and treatment

📊 Dataset Information

Source: Customer Segmentation Dataset (Mall Customer Data style)
Original Dataset: raw_dataset.csv (300 records with deliberate errors)
Cleaned Dataset: cleaned_dataset.csv (255 processed records ready for analysis)

Dataset Columns Handled:

· CustomerID - Unique customer identifier
· Gender - Customer gender (with inconsistencies)
· Age - Customer age (missing values and outliers)
· Annual Income (k$) - Income with various formats and symbols
· Spending Score (1-100) - Customer spending metric
· JoinDate - Multiple date formats
· Country - Inconsistent country naming
· Email - Validation and cleaning
· PurchaseCount - Transaction history
· LastPurchaseDate - Date standardization
· Churn - Customer retention status

🛠️ Technical Implementation

Tools & Technologies Used

· Python 3.x with Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
· Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis
· Data Validation Functions for business logic checks

Data Cleaning Pipeline

1. Data Quality Assessment

```python
# Initial assessment
print(f"Original dataset shape: {df.shape}")
print("Missing values per column:")
print(df.isnull().sum())
print(f"Duplicate records: {df.duplicated().sum()}")
```

2. Missing Values Treatment

· Numerical columns: Filled with median (Age, Income, Spending Score)
· Categorical columns: Filled with mode (Gender, Country)
· Date columns: Strategic imputation based on business logic
· Email validation: Separate flag for invalid emails

3. Duplicate Records Handling

· Removed 45 exact duplicate records using .drop_duplicates()
· Maintained data integrity while eliminating redundancy

4. Data Standardization

· Gender: Standardized to "Male"/"Female" format
· Country Names: Normalized to consistent format (Title Case)
· Column Headers: Converted to snake_case format
· Text Data: Stripped whitespace and standardized casing

5. Date Format Conversion

· Unified multiple date formats to dd-mm-yyyy
· Handled invalid date entries with error coercion
· Converted to datetime objects for proper analysis

6. Data Type Corrections

· Age → Integer with outlier treatment (10-100 range)
· Annual Income → Float with currency symbol removal
· Spending Score → Integer with range validation
· Date columns → DateTime objects

7. Outlier Detection & Treatment

· Identified outliers using IQR method
· Capped extreme values in numerical columns
· Treated invalid entries (negative ages, unrealistic values)

8. Data Validation & Business Logic

· Email format validation with proper checking
· Date consistency validation (last purchase ≥ join date)
· Churn flag standardization (Y/Yes/True/1 → 1, others → 0)

📊 Results & Performance Metrics

Data Quality Before Cleaning:

· Total Records: 300
· Missing Values: 47 entries across columns
· Duplicate Records: 45
· Inconsistent Formats: 89 entries
· Data Quality Score: 68%

Data Quality After Cleaning:

· Total Records: 255 (clean, unique records)
· Missing Values: 0 (completely resolved)
· Duplicate Records: 0 (100% removed)
· Consistent Formats: 100% achieved
· Data Quality Score: 98%

Key Improvements Achieved:

1. 100% Data Integrity - No missing values or duplicates
2. Format Consistency - Uniform data formats across all columns
3. Business Readiness - Dataset ready for analysis and modeling
4. Automated Pipeline - Reproducible cleaning process

🚀 Installation & Usage

Prerequisites

· Python 3.7+
· pip package manager

Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DataAnalyst_Task1_ElevateLabs.git
cd DataAnalyst_Task1_ElevateLabs

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Running the Cleaning Pipeline

Option 1: Using Jupyter Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/task1_cleaning.ipynb
```

Option 2: Using Python Script

```bash
python scripts/task1_cleaning.py
```

Option 3: Manual Execution

1. Examine data/raw_dataset.csv to understand initial data issues
2. Run the cleaning script to generate cleaned data
3. Verify results in data/cleaned_dataset.csv
4. Review docs/cleaning_report.md for detailed metrics

🔧 Customization & Extension

Adding New Data Quality Rules:

```python
# Example: Add custom validation rule
def validate_business_rules(df):
    # Age should be between 18-80 for most customers
    df['age_valid'] = df['age'].between(18, 80)
    # Income should be positive
    df['income_valid'] = df['annual_income'] > 0
    return df
```

Extending to Other Datasets:

The cleaning pipeline is modular and can be adapted for other datasets by modifying the configuration parameters and validation rules.
